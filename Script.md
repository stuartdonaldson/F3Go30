Script for Go30 Q Introduction
Slide 1: Introduction to Go30 Tracker

Welcome to the Go30 Tracker tutorial! In this video, we'll walk you through how the Go30 spreadsheet works, how the automation helps manage the process, and how to get started with a new month.

Slide 2: Overview of the Go30 Tracker

The Go30 Tracker is a Google Sheet designed to help PAX track their progress in the Go30 program. Each month, a new tracker spreadsheet is created to monitor daily goals and key activities.

Slide 3: Key Features of the Go30 Tracker

The Go30 Tracker includes several key features:

Daily goal tracking
Automated updates and reminders
Bonus points for key activities
Easy sharing and collaboration
Slide 4: Accessing the F3 Go30 Menu

To get started, make sure you are logged in as f3go30@gmail.com. This will give you access to the "F3 Go30" menu in the Google Sheet.

Animation: Show logging into Google and accessing the "F3 Go30" menu.

Slide 5: Copy and Initialize

The first step is to create a new tracker for the month. Select "Copy and Initialize" from the "F3 Go30" menu. Enter the new tracker name and start date when prompted.

Animation: Demonstrate selecting "Copy and Initialize" and entering the tracker name and start date.

Slide 6: Notification Pane Updates

The script will create a new tracker spreadsheet, copy the current HC form, and reset all worksheets. The notification pane will be populated with updates during this process, including links to the new spreadsheet and HC form.

Animation: Show the notification pane being populated with updates and links.

Slide 7: Initialize Triggers

Next, open the new tracker sheet by clicking the link in the notification pane. Open the "F3 Go30" menu and select "Initialize Triggers". This will set up the necessary triggers to populate the spreadsheet when a PAX fills out the HC form and flag missed check-ins with a -1 every night.

Animation: Demonstrate opening the new tracker sheet and selecting "Initialize Triggers".

Slide 8: Sharing Links

Open the new tracker sheet and navigate to the Tracker sheet. Save the current URL and share it with the PAX. It is best practice to shorten the URL using a service like tinyurl.com or bitly.com.

Animation: Show saving and shortening the URL, then sharing it.

Slide 9: PAX Usage Instructions

PAX should start by filling out the HC form to identify their Go30 goal. When a PAX submits their goal via the HC form, the form submit trigger runs and populates the Tracker sheet in the spreadsheet.

Animation: Demonstrate a PAX filling out the HC form and the Tracker sheet being updated.

Slide 10: Daily Tracking

As the month progresses, PAX will go to the Tracker sheet and place a 1 or a 0 on their row to indicate whether they achieved their goal for the day or not. At the end of the day, an automation runs and will place a -1 if the PAX did not fill out the form. There is a 24-hour grace period for filling out the form.

Animation: Show PAX updating the Tracker sheet daily and the automation placing -1 for missed check-ins.

Slide 11: Bonus Tracker

PAX can also fill out the Bonus Tracker sheet to get points for key activities such as EHing an FNG, Fellowship, Inspiration, and Qing.

Animation: Demonstrate filling out the Bonus Tracker sheet.

Slide 12: Next Steps

To get started with a new month:

Access the F3 Go30 Menu.
Copy and Initialize the new tracker.
Initialize Triggers.
Share the HC form and Tracker sheet links.

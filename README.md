# F3Go30
Automation, Scripts and HTML for Go30.
To learn more about Go30, see the explainer video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjn2qCLiHZY

PAX track their progress in the Go30 Google sheet which is released monthly.  

The automation includes:
* Auto fill in of the Tracker when the HC form is submitted
* Auto -1 for entries that have not been filled the previous day.
* Script to configure the triggers for the above.

A backlog of future work is on the f3Go30 google drive here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ChZv1rW5t4cvz5drk93XGBjc9M7KLhboQdcjerMwV58/edit?usp=sharing
